# Programming Assignment 1 
#### Code by Justin Shapiro

For the semester’s first programming assignment in CSCI 3415, we were given the task to embed JavaScript in an HTML document in order to provide a method of retrieving numerical values from the user, taking the average of those values, and returning a result of how many of those values are greater than the computed average. The sample program provided by Dr. Williams accomplished this task by having all user-input go into a window dialog, and a string containing the computation result printed to the HTML page. For this assignment, I decided to use JavaScript to have the user interact with the webpage entirely, and have the JavaScript return the report of the computation on webpage itself. I only used window dialogs to display error messages if the user did not type valid input. The process of getting JavaScript to interact with the HTML document by creating new `<div>` elements and modifying other existing elements provided me with a greater knowledge of the capabilities of JavaScript and subsequently introduced me to the workings of an untyped language.

The JavaScript code is embedded in `PA1.html` and resides between the `<script>` tags. Lines 6 – 137 contain all of the JavaScript. Below the ending `</script>` tag in lines 139 – 165, there exists a setup the initial HTML document with some stylistic elements and a hard-coded initial input box with an action.  When the initial input box is filled with a valid integer and the action button is pressed, the JavaScript will execute to do the remainder of the computation, including fetching specific numbers from the user. However, when the HTML document is first loaded, a JavaScript method `load()` is called first in order to instantiate a `numElements` value with whatever value will be in the initial input box. When `PA1.hmtl` is loaded, here is what the user should see:

When the “Continue” button is pressed, it calls the function `createNumInputs()`. This function will first check if the value in the input field is valid. Then, it dynamically creates a `<div>` element with a `<form>` that contains a number of input boxes equal to `numElements`. When the user enters their numbers in these dynamically created input fields, they will hit the “Run” button in order to run the computation and subsequently produce a report. The “Run” button, when clicked, calls the function `compute_result()`. This function makes use of JavaScript’s nested subprogram feature by having a method within `compute_result()` called `check_values()` that will first check the user’s input before performing the computation. After the computation is complete, a final function `generate_report()` is called in order to print the results in the HTML document for the user to review. At any time during this process, the user can enter a different number of elements to start the process over. The JavaScript code is designed to revert back to the document’s original state whenever `numElements` is changed by the user. The resulting report from the computation will look like this:

This was not only my first experience programming in JavaScript, but it was also my first experience programming in an untyped programming language. I found JavaScript’s implicit type declaration to be very convenient, giving it a write-ability greater than any other programming language I have worked with in the past. However, this convenience of type inference came at the cost of the program being difficult to debug. I found it hard to tell what the data type of a variable was when I was working with it, and often had to experiment with the methods `toString` and `parseInt` in order to obtain the correct results. I also found JavaScript’s nested subprograms feature to be useful regarding readability due to the fact that a method existing inside another method leads to a better organization of methods (rather than just having a long list of single methods). Since I am mainly experienced programming in C-based languages, JavaScript’s nested subprograms were an interesting new thing to play around with, but did not really contribute to overall write-ability. Overall, I really enjoyed using JavaScript and its features that are new to me such as implicit type declaration and nested subprograms as, not just a method for numerical computation, but more-so as a method of modifying an HTML document by dynamically creating elements as needed.
